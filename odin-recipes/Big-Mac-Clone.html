<h2>Directions</h2>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Shape ground beef into 4 flat patties that will fit the hamburger buns. Place them on a tray lined with waxed paper; transfer to the freezer.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
Mix mayonnaise, mustard, pickle relish, white wine vinegar, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika in a bowl to make sauce. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.
<h3>Step 3</h3>
Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Toast buns in batches until lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes.
<h3>Step 4</h3>
Layer some of the sauce, 1 tablespoon minced onion, 2 tablespoons lettuce, and pickles on 2 bottom buns. Layer some of the sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon minced onion, 2 tablespoons lettuce, and American cheese on the other bottom buns.
<h3>Step 5</h3>
Season patties with salt and pepper. Cook in the hot skillet 2 at a time until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place 1 patty over each bottom bun; stack and cover with top buns.
